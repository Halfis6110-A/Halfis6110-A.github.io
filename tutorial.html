    <h1>POWER-UPS</h1>
    <p>1.- In this new game player minus won this round, because 2 is greater than 1 </p>
    <img src = "Archivos/Tutorial7.PNG">
    <p>2.- But player plus used a POWER-UP and won that round, but how do POWER-UPS work?</p>
    <img src = "Archivos/Tutorial8.PNG">
    <p>3.- A POWER-UP is a special ability that allows you to multiply, add and do many other things to your score in order to win a round.</p>
    <p>4.- These are all the power-ups:</p>
    <p>ADD:</p>
    <p>If you use this power-up, you will add 2 points to your score.</p>
    <p>REMOVE:</p>
    <p>If you use this power-up the other player will lose two points.</p>
    <p>MULTIPLY:</p>
    <P>if you use this power-up your score will be multiplied by two</P>
    <p>SPLIT</p>
    <p>If you use this power-up, the other player's score will be divided by two.</p>
    <p>SQUARE ROOT</p>
    <p>If you use this power-up, the other player's score will become its square root.</p>
    <p>NOTE</p>
    <P>You can use a power-up only one time and you can use it any time</P>
    <p>NOTE</p>
    <P>In the calculator you can see if a number is greather, less, or equal</P>
